Incident management process enriched event log 
Introduction:
This is an event log of an incident management process extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNowTM platform used by an IT company. The event log is enriched with data loaded from a relational database underlying a corresponding process-aware information system. Information was anonymized for privacy.

Number of instances: 141,712 events (24,918 incidents)
Number of attributes: 36 attributes (1 case identifier, 1 state identifier, 32 descriptive attributes, 2 dependent variables)
Develop a model to predict the likelihood of an incident re-opening.
Evaluation Criteria:
Model Performance:  How well does the model predict the likelihood of an incident re-opening? Consider metrics like AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) or F1 score. 
Interpretability: Can you explain the factors that the model uses to predict re-opening? This is important for stakeholders to understand and trust the model's recommendations.
Actionable Insights:  Does the model identify specific features that can be used to proactively address incidents with a higher chance of re-opening?
